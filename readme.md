# TerraFork

![a 3d terrain](https://kellycode.github.io/terra-unTypeScriptified/preview.jpg)

From a fork of https://github.com/spacejack/terra

Updated to THREE r147  
Typescript and its dependencies removed.  
Organized to more OOP standards.  

Terra is brilliant but not particularly useful in its typescriptified state.  The grass needs to be a module that can be plugged into/onto any ground object and it should be a fairly direct process to add variety.

TODOs:  
Add a gulp builder for minification  
Extract the grass/wind bits for easy use
